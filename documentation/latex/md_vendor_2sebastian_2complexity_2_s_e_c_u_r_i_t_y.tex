The library that is developed in this repository was either extracted from \href{https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit}{\texttt{ PHPUnit}} or developed specifically as a dependency for \doxylink{namespace_p_h_p_unit}{PHPUnit}.

The library is developed with a focus on development environments and the command-\/line. No specific testing or hardening with regard to using the library in an HTTP or web context or with untrusted input data is performed. The library might also contain functionality that intentionally exposes internal application data for debugging purposes.

If the library is used in a web application, the application developer is responsible for filtering inputs or escaping outputs as necessary and for verifying that the used functionality is safe for use within the intended context.

Vulnerabilities specific to the use outside a development context will be fixed as applicable, provided that the fix does not have an averse effect on the primary use case for development purposes.
